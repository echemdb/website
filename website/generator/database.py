Data packages and bibliography built from local data.

This module provides a (cached) database of CVs which is queried when building
the website. In principle, this is no different than calling ``Database()``
directly. However, this uses data from the local ``data`` directory and it also
caches this information in a global variable for improved performance during
the website build.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from website.generator.database import cv
    >>> cv
    [...]
