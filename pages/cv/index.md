# Cyclic Voltammograms

The cyclic voltammograms (CVs[^1]) are categorized based on the type of system,
i.e., aquoues or non-aqueous, as well as common descriptors (tags) used by the
community to descibe an experiment. An entry can have several tags.

## Systems

* **[Aqueous](aqueous.md)**: Aqueous systems use water as a solvent, which is mixed with ions from an acid, a base, a salt, or a combination of such chemicals.
Other chemicals or gases can be added.
* **Non aqueous**: The ion conducting electrolyte can be a solid or a liquid.
In the case of a liquid, the solvent is either conductive itself,
as in **[Ionic Liquids](ionic_liquid.md)**, or it consists of a non-conductive solvent mixed with a salt.

## Tags

* **BCV**: We consider a base cyclic voltammogram as a CV that shows no electrocatalysis except possibly the decomposition of the electrolyte.
* **COOR**: CO Oxidation Reaction, usually studied in a CO saturated electrolyte.
* **HER**: Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.

    used for the technique cyclic voltammetry.
