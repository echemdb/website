# Cyclic Voltammograms

The cyclic voltammograms (CVs[^1]) are categorized based on the type of system,
i.e., aquoues or non-aqueous, as well as common descriptors (tags) used by the
community to descibe an experiment. An entry can have several tags.

To create, browse and compare specific datasets based on other search criteria,

## Systems

* **[Aqueous](aqueous.md)**: Aqueous systems use water as a solvent, which is mixed with ions from an acid, a base, a salt, or a combination of such chemicals.
Other chemicals or gases can be added.
* **Non aqueous**: The ion conducting electrolyte can be a solid or a liquid.
In the case of a liquid, the solvent is either conductive itself,
as in **[Ionic Liquids](ionic_liquid.md)**, or it consists of a non-conductive solvent mixed with a salt.

## Tags

* **BCV**: We consider a base cyclic voltammogram as a CV that shows no electrocatalysis except possibly the decomposition of the electrolyte.
* **COOR**: CO Oxidation Reaction, usually studied in a CO saturated electrolyte.
* **HER**: Hydrogen Evolution Reaction.

    Note that in the literature the abbreviation CV is sometimes
    used for the technique cyclic voltammetry.
