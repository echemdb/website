    linked measurements: # FTIR, SXRD, Ring Disc - indicate if any other operando methods were shown in the same plot, which is linked to the data
    comment: Scan rate is not given in paper, but can be obtained by comparison to charge integration as 20 mV/s  # Add whatever you think is important to understand the data

The electrode was annealed in a hydro- gen +air flame and then cooled down in a hydrogen atmosphere and later quenched with ultrapure water, before each experiment # Short description of sample preparation. This can be very useful. :)
