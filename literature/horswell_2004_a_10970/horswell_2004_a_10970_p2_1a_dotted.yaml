    linked measurements: in-situ Second Harmonic Generation, LEED, RHEED # FTIR, SXRD, Ring Disc - indicate if any other operando methods were shown in the same plot, which is linked to the data
    comment: Hg/HgO ref. is 0.165 V vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE ~ SHE). The scan rate is not mentioned in the publication, but can be calculated from the integrated charge provided in the publication, resulting in 50 mV/s. # Add whatever you think is important to understand the data
