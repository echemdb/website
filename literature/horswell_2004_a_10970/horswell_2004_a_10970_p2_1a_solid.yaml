    linked measurements: in-situ Second Harmonic Generation, LEED, RHEED # FTIR, SXRD, Ring Disc - indicate if any other operando methods were shown in the same plot, which is linked to the data
    comment: Hg/HgO ref. is 0.165 V vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE ~ SHE). Scan rate is not mentionend in the paper, but can be obtained by comparison to charge integral --> 50 mV/s # Add whatever you think is important to understand the data
