    linked measurements: # FTIR, SXRD, Ring Disc - indicate if any other operando methods were shown in the same plot, which is linked to the data
    comment: focus on Pt oxidation, surface defects (at steps), and sulfate vs. perchlorate adsorption # Add whatever you think is important to understand the data
