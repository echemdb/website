figure description: #This section will be updated by module `CV`
    version: 1
    linked measurements: EIS # FTIR, SXRD, Ring Disc - indicate if any other operando methods were shown in the same plot, which is linked to the data
    comment: For CV with KI, KClO4 is used instead of HClO4 (as for KCl, BrCl). # Add whatever you think is important to understand the data
